# Atlas

## Introduction

**Atlas** is a Nextflow-based pipeline developed for the processing and analysis of mass spectrometry data, specifically designed to assist proteomics laboratories with daily quality assessments across various proteomics applications. It supports multiple workflows, such as regular proteomes, phosphoproteomes, and independent acquisition modes, among others.

With these diverse workflows, **Atlas** extracts critical quality control parameters, simplifying the evaluation of mass spectrometry experiments. **Atlas** can be configured to use various search engines, including:

- **[Fragpipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/)** 
- **[Comet](http://comet-ms.sourceforge.net/)**
- **[Mascot](https://www.matrixscience.com)**
- **[DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN)**

The pipeline is implemented using the latest **Nextflow DSL2 syntax** and is designed to operate efficiently in **HPC (High-Performance Computing) environments**.
